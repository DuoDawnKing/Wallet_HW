# Wallet_HW
In this code, we will be setting up a streamlit profile to find and pay employees in the rate of ether to their accounts. we will have four selected members. We set up an public account, which will be used to select the person and their balance accounts and more. They will determine the amount of hours used and then it would determine the value of ether and from there it would have a send button which would commit the transaction which would move ether from the account and will transfer it. This will be used to pay workers that use digital wallets. The images shows the ganache of before and after, the other image is how streamlit displays the layout

In this example, we do a transaction of .1881, which is then pulled from our account which i seen in ganache after image. This confirms the transaction from us to the employee
